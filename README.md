# Project-Deep-Learning-Team-7
To my dearest lecturers Mr. Tamaro and Mr. Ardika. This GitHub repository is dedicated to a deep learning project that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to clasification coffee leaves . CNNs have proven to be a powerful tool for image recognition and object detection.Tthis project explores it's applications and implementations.
